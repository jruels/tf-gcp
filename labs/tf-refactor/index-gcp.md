# Terraform Refactor codebase

## Overview 
In this lab, you will refactor a monolithic Terraform configuration into a more maintainable design. 

You will start with two copies of a web application hosted in Cloud Storage buckets (one for production, one for development). Then you will refactor this to use a single set of resources with environment-specific variables.

## Start with a monolith configuration
### Create the Lab Directory

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the working directory created in the previous lab (`YYYYMMDD/terraform`).
2. Right-click in the **Explorer** pane and select **New Folder**.
3. Name the folder `tf-lab7`.
4. Create the following files in your `tf-lab7` directory:

`main.tf` - configures the resources that make up your infrastructure:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region  = var.region
}

resource "random_pet" "petname" {
  length    = 3
  separator = "-"
}

# Production bucket
resource "google_storage_bucket" "prod" {
  name          = "${var.prod_prefix}-${random_pet.petname.id}"
  location      = var.region
  force_destroy = true

  uniform_bucket_level_access = true

  website {
    main_page_suffix = "index.html"
    not_found_page   = "404.html"
  }
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "prod" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.prod.name
  role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member = "allUsers"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "prod" {
  name          = "index.html"
  bucket        = google_storage_bucket.prod.name
  content       = file("${path.module}/assets/index.html")
  content_type  = "text/html"
}

# Development bucket
resource "google_storage_bucket" "dev" {
  name          = "${var.dev_prefix}-${random_pet.petname.id}"
  location      = var.region
  force_destroy = true

  uniform_bucket_level_access = true

  website {
    main_page_suffix = "index.html"
    not_found_page   = "404.html"
  }
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "dev" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.dev.name
  role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member = "allUsers"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "dev" {
  name          = "index.html"
  bucket        = google_storage_bucket.dev.name
  content       = file("${path.module}/assets/index.html")
  content_type  = "text/html"
}
```

`variables.tf` - declares input variables:

```hcl
variable "project_id" {
  description = "Google Cloud Project ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region for GCP resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "prod_prefix" {
  description = "Prefix for production resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "prod"
}

variable "dev_prefix" {
  description = "Prefix for development resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"
}
```

`terraform.tfvars` - defines your variables:

```hcl
project_id  = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
region      = "us-central1"
prod_prefix = "prod"
dev_prefix  = "dev"
```

`outputs.tf` - specifies the website endpoints:

```hcl
output "prod_website_url" {
  description = "URL of the production website"
  value       = "https://storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.prod.name}/index.html"
}

output "dev_website_url" {
  description = "URL of the development website"
  value       = "https://storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.dev.name}/index.html"
}
```

Create an `assets` directory and add an `index.html` file with some sample content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Static Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Initialize and apply your Terraform configuration:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Navigate to the web addresses from the Terraform output to display the deployments in a browser.

## Refactor the configuration

Having duplicate resources for each environment creates maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies. Let's refactor to use a single set of resources with environment-specific variables.

1. Update `variables.tf` to use environment variables:

```hcl
variable "project_id" {
  description = "Google Cloud Project ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region for GCP resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment (dev or prod)"
  type        = string
}

variable "environment_prefix" {
  description = "Prefix for resource names"
  type        = string
}
```

2. Create environment-specific variable files:

`dev.tfvars`:
```hcl
project_id         = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
region            = "us-central1"
environment       = "dev"
environment_prefix = "dev"
```

`prod.tfvars`:
```hcl
project_id         = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
region            = "us-central1"
environment       = "prod"
environment_prefix = "prod"
```

3. Update `main.tf` to use a single set of resources:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region  = var.region
}

resource "random_pet" "petname" {
  length    = 3
  separator = "-"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "website" {
  name          = "${var.environment_prefix}-${random_pet.petname.id}"
  location      = var.region
  force_destroy = true

  uniform_bucket_level_access = true

  website {
    main_page_suffix = "index.html"
    not_found_page   = "404.html"
  }

  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "website" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.website.name
  role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member = "allUsers"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "website" {
  name          = "index.html"
  bucket        = google_storage_bucket.website.name
  content       = file("${path.module}/assets/index.html")
  content_type  = "text/html"
}
```

4. Update `outputs.tf` to use the single resource:

```hcl
output "website_url" {
  description = "URL of the website"
  value       = "https://storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.website.name}/index.html"
}
```

## Deploy the environments

Deploy to development:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

After testing, destroy the dev environment:
```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

Deploy to production:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

## Cleanup

Clean up the resources:
```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

## Congratulations!

You have successfully:
1. Started with a monolithic configuration that had duplicate resources
2. Refactored it to use a single set of resources with environment-specific variables
3. Learned how to deploy to different environments using tfvars files

## Problems with this Approach

While the above approach works, it has several drawbacks:

1. **Code Duplication**: Having separate directories means duplicating code between environments, which can lead to:
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Inconsistencies between environments
   - Higher chance of errors when making changes

2. **Harder to Add Environments**: Adding a new environment (like staging) requires:
   - Creating a new directory
   - Copying all files
   - Maintaining another set of identical code

3. **No Single Source of Truth**: When infrastructure code exists in multiple places, it's harder to:
   - Ensure all environments are using the same resource configurations
   - Track changes across environments
   - Maintain consistency

## A Better Approach

A better way to manage multiple environments is to:

1. Keep a single set of Terraform configurations
2. Use environment-specific `.tfvars` files
3. Use workspace or backend configurations for state management

Example:

Instead of separate directories, your structure should look like:
```
.
├── assets/
│   └── index.html
├── main.tf           # Single source of truth for all environments
├── variables.tf      # All variable definitions
├── outputs.tf        # All outputs
├── dev.tfvars       # Development environment values
└── prod.tfvars      # Production environment values
```

Then deploy to different environments using:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"   # For development
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"  # For production
```

Benefits:
1. Single source of truth for infrastructure code
2. Easy to add new environments (just add a new .tfvars file)
3. Guaranteed consistency between environments
4. Easier to maintain and update
5. Better version control and change tracking

## Next Steps

In a real-world scenario, you would:
1. Use different state files for each environment (using backend configuration)
2. Implement proper state locking
3. Use CI/CD pipelines for deployments
4. Add environment-specific access controls
